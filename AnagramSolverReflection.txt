Assesement 6: AnagramSolver Reflection

1) What did you learn from working on this 
assignment?

I learned the backtracking recursion application in compute combinations and possibilities.

2) What did you struggle most with on this 
assignment? How did you work to overcome 
that struggle (even if you weren't able to)?

I struggled most on how to start and where to start the recursion. I solved this by review the 
demo we learned in class and try to find the logic behind the pattern.

3) How will you use what you learned from 
this assignment to improve your process or 
approach on future assignments?

We may use some recursion to replace the while or for loop. Sometimes, it is more convenient
to use recursion than using for loop.

4) Was any part of the specification or 
requirements unclear? If so, what part(s), 
and how could it have been made clearer?

No, I don't think so. This spe is very clear.

5) About how many hours did you spend working 
on this assignment? (Estimates are fine, but 
try to get close)

About 3 hours overall.
